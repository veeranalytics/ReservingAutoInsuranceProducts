# Reserving Auto Insurance Products

### Reserving Model for Auto Insurance Using Chain-Ladder Algorithm.
The insurance industry, unlike other industries, does not sell products as such, but rather promises. An insurance policy 
is a promise by the insurer to the policyholder to pay for future claims for an upfront received premium.

As a result, insurers do not know the upfront cost for their service, but rely on historical data analysis and judgment to 
predict a sustainable price for their offering. In General Insurance (or Non-Life Insurance, e.g. motor, property and 
casualty insurance); most policies run for a period of 12 months. However, the claims payment process can take years
or even decades. Therefore, often not even the delivery date of their product is known to insurers.


### Chain-Ladder Algorithm:
The classical chain-ladder method is a deterministic algorithm to forecast claims based
on historical data. It assumes that the proportional developments of claims from one development
period to the next is the same for all origin periods.
